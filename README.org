Personal Configuration File (Dotfile) Repository. 

Files which end in the =org= file extension are orgmode literate configs, and do not contain the actual config files for a given program. Rather these orgmode files contain source code blocks which are tangled or pushed to the proper config files on demand. To reduce confusion, the =org= files in each subdirectory has been named according to the program it relates to. 

For example:
- the Hyprland config is named: =hyprland.org=
- the Waybar config is named: =waybar.org=
  
One notable exeption to this naming convention is, I have named my emacs config ~README.org~ instead of ~emacs.org~. The reason I have named the emacs this way is because Github only automatically expands orgmode or markdown files if they are named README, and given the complexity of my emacs config I wanted the orgmode document to auto expand for better readability.
